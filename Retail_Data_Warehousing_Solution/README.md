The solution will include source system analysis (data profiling) in Alteryx, data staging, ETL development in Talend to extract, transform, and load data from data source into a Ralph Kimball-Star schema dimensional model in Amazon Redshift, as well as development and testing of the entire data integration workflow. The resulting data will be visualized using interactive dashboards in Tableau
